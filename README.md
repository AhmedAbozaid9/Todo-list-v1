# Todo-list-v1
## beware!
this might be the worst to do app you will ever see in your life <br/>
i wanted to try to create a todo app by myself so i spent the whole day trying to figure out how to do it and how to manipulate the DOM to do what i want and in the end...
[i made this](https://ahmedtodoappv1.netlify.app/). i was just so happy because i knew how to really make it but the look of it wasn't good, so instead of adding more css i watched a tutorial on how to make a to do app and marked my mistakes, then i made a [second version of the Todo app](https://github.com/AhmedAbozaid9/Todo-list-v2).
